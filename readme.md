Flappy Bird is an App created by the vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen(2013) and published by Gears Studios.
The graphics of the game are similar to Super Mario World and comparatively simple. The player controlls the 
bird by tapping and maneuver it through the, from right to left, scrolling world, where he needs to dodge the pipes which are coming 
from below and above. Every time the bird passes through the opening between the pipes, he score a point. 
If he collid with them, the game is over.

draw images, texts, etc. to the screen and deliever the same experience.
